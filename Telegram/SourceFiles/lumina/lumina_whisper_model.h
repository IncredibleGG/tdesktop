// The one offline model LuminaGram's desktop whisper.cpp engine uses: the
// multilingual, q5_1-quantized "base" model, which auto-detects the spoken
// language (exactly what a cross-language chat needs) at ~59 MB. It is hosted
// on the project's own R2 bucket and downloaded once, on demand, from the
// Voice-to-Text settings page. The bytes stay on the machine; no audio is ever
// uploaded by this engine.
//
// This is the desktop counterpart of Android's LuminaVoskModelManager, but a
// single file rather than a zip, so there is no unzip step - only the same
// tmp-then-atomic-rename discipline so a half-finished download can never be
// mistaken for a ready model.

// tdata/luminagram-models/ggml-base-q5_1.bin under the working directory.

	// never requested, a download the user cancelled, and a deleted model -
