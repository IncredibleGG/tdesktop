// The single seam LuminaGram has into the profile "details" block built by
// Info::Profile::DetailsFiller::makeInfo() (info/profile/info_profile_actions
// .cpp). That file is 3000+ lines of upstream-hot code, so it holds exactly two
// calls into this header and nothing else; every LuminaGram profile row is
// added from here instead.
//
// Mirrors the `addInfoOneLine` factory local to makeInfo(). Rows created
// through it are added to the same Ui::VerticalLayout and tracked by the same
// Ui::MultiSlideTracker as their upstream neighbours, so a row whose text
// producer emits an empty value slides itself away, and the details block as a
// whole still collapses when every row inside it is empty.
//
// Arguments are (label, text, contextCopyText); the padding and popup menu
// style arguments of the upstream factory keep their defaults.
//
// !! CALL-SCOPED ONLY. The wrapped lambda holds references into makeInfo()'s
// stack frame - in particular to its local Ui::MultiSlideTracker, which is
// destroyed as soon as makeInfo() returns. Call it synchronously from
// AddUserInfoRows() / AddChatInfoRows() and never copy it into a click
// handler, an rpl subscription, a lifetime-owned state or any other callback
// that runs later.

// A full-width, clickable settings-button row (the same widget the upstream
// action buttons in info_profile_actions.cpp use), tracked by makeInfo()'s
// MultiSlideTracker just like every other row in the details block: when
// `shown` emits false the row slides away, and when every row in the block is
// hidden the block still collapses. Use it for a row that has to react to a
// tap; use addInfoOneLine for a plain labelled value.
//
// !! CALL-SCOPED, exactly like addInfoOneLine above: the wrapped lambda holds
// references into makeInfo()'s stack frame (its layout and its
// Ui::MultiSlideTracker). Invoke it synchronously from AddChatInfoRows() /
// AddUserInfoRows() and never copy it into a later callback.
//
// `onClick`, by contrast, is owned by the button and runs on tap long after
// makeInfo() has returned, so it must capture only things that outlive the
// section - context.controller and the peer pointers are safe (see the note on
// ProfileRowsContext), makeInfo()'s locals are not.

	// on a peer where every upstream row happens to be empty an untracked
	// Lumina row is built but never shown. If a future row really cannot go
	// through the factory, wrap it in a Ui::SlideWrap and extend this struct
	// with a tracking callback rather than adding it bare.

// another rpl source) rather than from a value computed once, or the row will
// never update after the peer is refreshed from the server, and an initially
// empty row will stay hidden forever.

// The user branch. Deliberately called for bots as well - private contact
// notes have to be available on bot profiles too - so a row that does not
// apply to bots must check `user->isBot()` itself. Likewise it is called for
// `user->isSelf()` and for Saved Messages sublist sections (where makeInfo()
// builds the details of `sublist->sublistPeer()`); a row that should not show
// up there has to test for it.
