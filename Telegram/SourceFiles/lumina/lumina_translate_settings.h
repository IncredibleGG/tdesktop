// The LuminaGram translation settings sub-page, and the preferences that have
// no other owner.
//
// The page presents two directions, deliberately not one "translate to"
// setting:
//
//  * send side - TranslateBeforeSend() rewrites an outgoing message into
//    TranslateSendLanguage(), which defaults to "auto", meaning "whatever the
//    peer writes in";
//  * read side - DualLanguageDisplay() shows an incoming message together with
//    its translation into the read language, which defaults to unset, meaning
//    "follow the interface language".
//
// On both sides the original text stays the large one and the translation the
// small one; that is a rendering decision and lives with the renderer.
//
// Where a value already has an owner, this file does not declare a second
// accessor for it - it renders the row and writes through that owner:
//
//   provider, API keys, LLM base URL / model / prompt, Telegram fallback
//                                       lumina/lumina_translate_providers.h
//   the master switch, and the tier it governs
//                                       lumina/lumina_translate_gating.h
//
// trReadLang goes the other way: the key is declared and written here, and
// lumina/lumina_translate_readlang.h only projects it onto the LanguageId
// shape stock tdesktop's read path expects.
//
// THE PAGE IS A SWITCH, AN ENGINE AND TWO DEFAULT LANGUAGES. It used to carry a
// mode (every chat / only chats I turn on) and a scope (private chats, groups
// and channels) as well. Both existed only to decide WHICH chats translate
// automatically, and the user now makes that decision per chat, by hand, in the
// chat itself - so both were two more things that could go wrong for no
// benefit. Their keys - trMode, trScopePrivate, trScopeGroup - are no longer
// written and no longer read; a profile that still has them keeps three unread
// entries in its pref file and nothing else. Do not re-add a preference here
// that answers a question a chat can answer about itself.
//
// The scope keys were the only ones whose removal a user can feel. They also
// narrowed translate-before-send, so a profile that had turned "Groups and
// channels" off and translate-before-send on now translates outgoing messages
// in groups too. Both scope keys defaulted to on and translate-before-send
// defaults to off, so that is the intersection of two deliberate choices; the
// send-menu row and the per-chat send language are where it is controlled now.
//
// Every key this file owns defaults to stock Telegram Desktop behaviour: both
// send-side toggles off, dual-language display off, send language "auto" and
// read language unset.
//
// The page is NOT behaviour-neutral overall, and the reason is not here: the
// provider row reads Lumina::CurrentProviderId(), whose unset value resolves
// through Lumina::DefaultProviderId() to "google_web", not to "telegram"
// (lumina/lumina_translate_providers.cpp). On a fresh profile the Service row
// therefore reads "Google", the "fall back to Telegram" toggle is visible, and
// Lumina::UsingOwnProvider() is already true - which relaxes the Premium gate
// in lumina/lumina_translate_gating.h before the user has chosen anything.
// That is W1-A's product decision and is documented there and in the gating
// header; this file only renders it. If it is ever reverted to "telegram", no
// change is needed here.
