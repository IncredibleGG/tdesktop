namespace Lumina {

// LuminaGram's translation backend: the user's own engine or API key instead
// of Telegram's paid service.
//
// Two layers, because they cannot be one:
//
//  * TranslateEngine is the LuminaGram-native one. It takes and returns plain
//    QString, and its target language is a full language *code* ("zh-TW"), not
//    a LanguageId. This is the layer every LuminaGram feature should use.
//  * CreateTranslateProvider() adapts an engine to Ui::TranslateProvider so
//    that tdesktop's own translate bar, translate box and per-chat translation
//    keep working unchanged.
//
// The split exists because of the dialect blocker: Ui::TranslateProvider takes
// a LanguageId, which is a bare QLocale::Language with no script and no region
// (spellcheck/spellcheck_types.h), so it cannot tell zh-TW from zh-CN, pt-BR
// from pt-PT or en-GB from en-US. This fork's own interface is zh-TW, so
// carrying LanguageId around would ship Simplified Chinese to every user.
// Anything inside namespace Lumina therefore carries QString codes end to end,
// and LanguageId appears only at the tdesktop boundary, where
// TargetLanguageCode() recovers as much of the dialect as it can.

// Stable provider ids. They are persisted, so they must never change.
[[nodiscard]] QString TelegramProviderId();   // "telegram"

// The free, keyless Google web engine, so that translation works out of the

// TelegramProviderId(), never to this one.

//
// It therefore also requires TranslateProviderConfigured(): a provider that
// needs an API key but has none answers TranslateError::NoKey on every
// request, and TranslateFallbackToTelegram() - which is on by default - then
// retries the whole thing through Telegram's own engine. Selecting DeepL and
// entering no key would otherwise unlock the Premium-gated whole-chat
// translation and then serve every message from Telegram's paid service,
// which is exactly the thing this predicate exists to prevent.
// Whether the user has actually picked an engine on the Service row, as
