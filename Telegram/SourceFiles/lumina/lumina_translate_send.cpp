// Tag-preserving translation ---------------------------------------------
//
// A formatted outgoing message carries its mention / bold / custom-emoji
// ranges as {offset, length, id} tags into TextWithTags::text, in UTF-16 code
// units - the same unit QString indexes in, so a custom-emoji span that is a
// surrogate pair needs no special handling as long as every length below is
// taken from QString too.
//
// Translating the text would move every character and leave those offsets
// pointing at the wrong ones, which is why a tagged message used to be refused.
// Instead each tagged span is replaced, before translation, by a sentinel
// token built from Private Use Area markers that translation engines pass
// through unchanged; the text around it is translated; and on write-back each
// sentinel is swapped back for its original span text verbatim (so a mention's
// display name is never translated) with a fresh tag offset measured against
// the rebuilt string.
//
// The markers are U+F8FE / U+F8FD, one UTF-16 unit each and never whitespace,
// so trimming the protected string cannot eat one. The digits between them are
// the span's index, and the closing marker keeps one token from ever being a
// prefix of another (\uF8FE 1 \uF8FD is not inside \uF8FE 1 2 \uF8FD).
//
// They sit at the TOP of the BMP private-use area on purpose. The glossary
// masker (lumina_glossary.cpp) wraps every engine (GlossaryEngine in
// lumina_translate_providers.cpp) and, whenever the outgoing text carries a
// glossary term, a textual @mention or a URL, replaces each with a placeholder
// numbered from U+E000 UPWARD and then, on the reply, rewrites every character
// in [U+E000, U+E000 + count) back. Markers low in that area (U+E000 / U+E001)
// would be indices 0 and 1 and get clobbered on exactly the messages this
// feature is for; the round-trip check below would then fall back to as-typed
// every time. From the top, the glossary would have to mask ~6400 spans in one
